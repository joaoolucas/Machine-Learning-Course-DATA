## First week - kNN algorithm

In the first class we learned how the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) works. KNN is a non-parametric classification, that can be used in machine learning to classify data based on how similar they are with the already known data.

The algorithm calculates the distance between the points in the space based on a previous defined parameter (k = number of neighbours) and if they are close, they will be definied with the same classification. The distance between the points used can be Manhattan or Euclidean.
